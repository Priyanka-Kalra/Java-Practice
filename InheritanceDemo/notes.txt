1. Multiple Inheritance does not work in Java, it means on class can not inherit from two or more parent class, bcz of ambiguity.

2. Every class in java extends Object class(super class)

3. we can use this() to call other constructor of same class.

4. The Calc class has a parameterized constructor but no default (no-argument) constructor.When you a subclass AdvCal is instantiated, Java implicitly tries to call the superclass's no-argument constructor unless you explicitly call another constructor in the superclass. So to explicitly call parameterised constructer of super calss we use 'super()' here, super() calls constructor of super class

5. we import java.lang.* by default ,System is being imported from java.lang.System

6.We can create a reference of superclass and obj of subclass, eg:

public class A{}
public class B extends A{}

so in main, we can use: A obj=new B();

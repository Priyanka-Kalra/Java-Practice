1. Using final:
We can make a variable constant
We can stop inheritance of a class by using final
We can avoid function overriding by using final 

2. upcasting/downcasting-check it out
3. polymorphism-check it out

for overriding(based on access modifier)

4.storing the primitive value/variable to the corresponding wrapper class is boxing
5. taking primitive value from corresponding wrapper class in unboxing

6. Abstarct class can only have abstract methods
7. we cant create obj of abstract class, but refrence of abstract class can be made
abstract class A{}
class B extends A{}

so in main, we can use: A obj=new B();
but not A obj=new A();

8. In Interfaces, all the methods are 'abstract public' by default
9.we can access variables of interface without having to declare obj(but variables are static and final)
10.see video 76

11. We have 3 types of interface:
    a.Normal- with 2 or more methods
    b.Functional/SAM(Single Abstract Method)-with one method
    c.Marker- with zero methods

12. Serialisation, storing values/objects(from runtime) in hard drive of system- using Marker Interface

13. Functional Interfaces helps in utilising lambda expressions

14. throw and throws diff

15. 'println' is a method of 'PrintStream' class
now to call method, we require object of the class, In this case 'out' is the object
this object 'out' is created as a static variable in 'System' class
System.out.println()

Similary System.in.read(), 'read' is method of 'InputStream' class with object as 'in', 
'in' is created as a static variable in 'System' class
